# BeaverCDS (Challenge Deployment System)

![Image Alt Text](/BeaverCDS-landing/img/scoreboard.PNG)

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the BeaverCDS project is to create a robust and flexible deployment system tailored for Capture The Flag (CTF) events, enhancing the existing rCDS framework by addressing dependency and infrastructure challenges.

## Problem Solved
The BeaverCDS project resolves significant issues encountered in the rCDS framework, including package dependencies and infrastructure limitations. By transitioning from Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS), BeaverCDS offers a more reliable and scalable solution. This is particularly beneficial for educational institutions and security clubs hosting large-scale CTF events.

### Case Study
The updated BeaverCDS project was utilized during the DamCTF event hosted by the Security Club at OSU. Approximately 200 teams participated, using the software concurrently. The live event highlighted documentation issues, but the robustness of BeaverCDS allowed these challenges to be worked around, demonstrating the effectiveness of the improvements made to the original rCDS framework.

## Value Proposition
BeaverCDS stands out from the competition due to its:
- **Enhanced Dependency Management:** Utilizing the updated package manager, Poetry, to ensure smooth operation.
- **Improved Infrastructure:** Transition from GKE to EKS for better scalability and reliability.
- **Comprehensive Training:** Team training in AWS EKS to ensure expertise in the new system.
- **Proven Effectiveness:** Successfully supported a large-scale, real-world CTF event.
